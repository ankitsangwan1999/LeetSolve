## What am I looking at?
**LeetSolve** - A cross-platform desktop application showing algorithm problems attempted by you on Leetcode.

## Why it exists?
Sometimes back **Leetcode** did not show all the **attempted** problems(AC/Non-AC) by the user at one place. Particularly, **Non-AC** problems are important for students preparing for **interviews** as they want to solve them eventually. Categorizing all such problems based on their **Difficulty Level** and **Acceptance Rate** becomes helpful. 


## How to run it locally?
1. > ***Clone this repo to your local machine and cd into the LeetSolve directory.***
2.     npm i
   > This will download all the required dependencies for the application to run on your local machine.
3.     npm start
   > This will run the script corresponding to 'start' in package.json

## How to use this?
Step-1:
> Login to your account on leetcode.com in any browser of your choice.

Step 2:
> After Login, Check the Cookies set by **leetcode.com** for you.
For e.g. in Chrome/Firefox you can go to **Dev Tool** -> **Application** Tab -> **Cookies** -> **https://leetcode.com**.

Step 3:
> Copy the value corresponding to '**LEETCODE_SESSION**' and paste it inside the form shown in LeetSolve App.

**Note:** This cookie value will be valid until you do not logout from https://leetcode.com. Once logged out. Follow the above 3 steps again.
